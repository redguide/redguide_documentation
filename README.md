# Chef Red Guide Community Resource Documentation

This is the relevant documentation for all cookbooks and tools in this [github organization](https://github.com/redguide).

## Why not stick this documentation in each repo?

In an effort to minimize duplication, and increase the ease of use of community maintainers to be able to quickly assess, contribute, and add to the cookbooks we've centralized the documentation for the Red Guide managed cookbooks and tools within this organization.
